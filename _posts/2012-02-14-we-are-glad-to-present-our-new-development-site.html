title: OpenCV has migrated to a new development site
---
<p>We are glad to present our new development site, <a href="http://code.opencv.org">http://code.opencv.org</a>. From now on, the site will be the place to get cutting-edge OpenCV snapshots, access our repository and to report bugs/post requests.</p>
<p><a href="https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/">https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/</a> will be available in read-only mode for a short period of time before it's completely removed.<br />
<a href="https://code.ros.org/svn/opencv/">https://code.ros.org/trac/opencv/</a> - all the open tickets have been migrated to Redmine at <a href="http://code.opencv.org">code.opencv.org</a>.</p>
<p>Happy OpenCV'ing!</p>
