title: OpenCV v2.4.2 released
---
<p>Despite the holidays and hot summer days, OpenCV dev team continues to work hard for you, dear users. We've just prepared the next update in OpenCV 2.4 series, called 2.4.2. It should be binary compatible with OpenCV 2.4.1 (except for the face recognizer from contrib module) and therefore it is a sincerely recommended upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks to everybody who helped to make the release this good!</p>
<p>OpenCV 2.4.2 is available as a package at <a href="{{ site.link_sf }}/">SourceForge</a> or as a snapshot (tagged as 2.4.2) of our OpenCV 2.4 branch in SVN:<br />
<a href="http://code.opencv.org/svn/opencv/branches/2.4/opencv"> http://code.opencv.org/svn/opencv/branches/2.4/opencv</a></p>
<p>The nicely formatted changelog can be seen here: <a href="http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog">http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog</a> and here is the text-only version:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not about the code, but now we have the brand-new user site and the new stack overflow-like site with answers to most popular questions <a href="{{ site.link_forum }}">{{ site.link_forum }}</a>.</li>
<li>Android package introduces a new service-based distribution model (see <a href="http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/Android_Release_Notes">http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/Android_Release_Notes</a> for details).</li>
<li>opencv2.framework for iOS has been created. You can either download the binary from SourceForge or build it yourself using the simple guide. Also, you may be interested to look at some OpenCV on iOS samples, created by our GSoC 2012 students Eduard and Charu: <a href="http://code.opencv.org/svn/gsoc2012/ios/trunk">http://code.opencv.org/svn/gsoc2012/ios/trunk</a> and read the <a href="http://code.opencv.org/svn/gsoc2012/ios/trunk/doc/CVPR2012_OpenCV4IOS_Tutorial.pdf">slides</a> of the tutorial.</li>
<li>New keypoint descriptor FREAK has been contributed by EPFL group: Kirell Benzi, Raphael Ortiz, Alexandre Alahi and Pierre Vandergheynst. It's claimed to be superior to ORB and SURF descriptors, yet it's very fast (comparable to ORB). Please, see <a href="http://code.opencv.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv/samples/cpp/freak_demo.cpp">http://code.opencv.org/svn/opencv/trunk/opencv/samples/cpp/freak_demo.cpp</a>.</li>
<li>Improved face recognizer and excellent tutorial on using it has been added by Philipp Wagner. Check the tutorial at <a href="{{ site.link_docs }}/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/index.html">{{ site.link_docs }}/2.4/modules/contrib/doc/facerec/index.html</a>.</li>
<li>Another 50 bugs have been fixed since 2.4.1 release.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are welcome to try out the latest and greatest OpenCV!</p>
