<p>While the work on OpenCV 2.5 is going on, our Development Team decided to prepare another release in the 2.4 series for you.<br />
The focus of the coming 2.4.4 release is stability. We haven't added many new features to the library, but worked hard on quality and usability of existing ones.</p>
<p>Big thanks to all contributers who made pull requests on Github, sent bug reports and helped us in any other way!</p>
<p>As usual, the 2.4.4 beta packages are available on <a href="{{ site.link_sf }}/files/"> SourceForge</a> or alternatively you can download the source code from <a href="{{ site.link_gh }}/opencv/tree/2.4.4-beta">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The brief changes log is:<br />
- OpenCV Java bindings are ported from Android to desktop Java!<br />
- Android application framework, samples, tutorials, and OpenCV4Android Manager are improved<br />
- Kepler optimizations, CARMA platform support and other new optimizations in CUDA<br />
- ocl module now builds successfully with various OpenCL SDKs (from AMD, NVidia and Apple)<br />
- 100+ reported problems have been resolved since 2.4.3<br />
