short: As of OpenCV 2.4.4, OpenCV supports desktop Java development using nearly the
    same interface as for Android development.
title: OpenCV now supports desktop Java

<p>OpenCV now has bindings for desktop Java, updating the set of supported languages to C / C++, Python, Android, Java and any JVM language which interops with Java, such as Scala and Clojure. The existing Java API for Android has recently been extended to support desktop Java as well. Unlike the popular <a href="http://code.google.com/p/javacv/">JavaCV</a> project, these bindings are automatically generated by parsing the OpenCV C++ headers. This has two major advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Java wrapper is automatically kept up-to-date.</li>
<li>The bindings closely match the original C++ interface. More information is available in the new <a href="{{ site.link_docs }}/2.4.11/doc/tutorials/introduction/desktop_java/java_dev_intro.html">tutorial</a>. In case of any suggestions, please put all your ideas to the <a href="{{ site.link_gh }}/opencv/issues">tracker</a>!</li>
<li>The Java API documentation is available <a href="{{ site.link_docs }}/java/2.4.11/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
