<p>The book “OpenCV: Computer Vision with Python” provides a fast-paced introduction to OpenCV’s Python bindings using a real-time face-tracking project as an example. Integration with NumPy and SciPy, and optional integration with OpenNI and SensorKinect, is also covered.</p>
<p>Topics, by chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, OpenNI, and SensorKinect on Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu.</li>
<li>Working with cameras, image/video files, and GUIs using OpenCV. Understanding how OpenCV uses NumPy arrays as image data.</li>
<li>Applying filters to live video using OpenCV and SciPy.</li>
<li>Tracking and manipulating faces using OpenCV.</li>
<li>Refining face tracking results using data from a depth camera, such as Microsoft Kinect or Asus XtionPRO.</li>
<li>Replacing OpenCV’s built-in GUI system with a 3rd-party alternative, such as PyGame.</li>
<li>Training OpenCV to track custom targets, not just faces.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in 100 pages!</p>
