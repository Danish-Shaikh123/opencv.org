<p>In this follow-up webinar Dr. Sadiye Guler, the founder of intuVision, Inc. will introduce intuVision's video object detection and tracking algorithms. In intuVision video tracking systems, parallel operations such as background model generation, update and new frame to background comparisons, as well as image filtering operations are performed much faster on GPUs resulting in large savings in processing time. By performing only the inherently non-parallel operations on the CPU, and utilizing multi-thread processing on the GPU, the overall computational performance of video analytics experiences a significant boost beyond real-time. <a href="https://global.gotowebinar.com/register/953266946">Register</a> for free to attend the online event.</p>
