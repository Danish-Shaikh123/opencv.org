<p>Targeted at computer vision amateurs who are well-versed in C++, <strong>Practical OpenCV</strong> takes a project-based approach to introduce various modules of the ubiquitous OpenCV computer vision software library. The book also discusses theoretical concepts behind the various vision algorithms and has a special chapter on running your vision programs on the Raspberry Pi, including OpenCV wrappers for the Raspberry Pi camera board API.</p>
<p>Chapters are organized to deal with one or two OpenCV modules per chapter. Contents at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing OpenCV on your computer</li>
<li>OpenCV demos</li>
<li>Basic operations on images and GUI tools</li>
<li>Image filtering</li>
<li>Shapes in images</li>
<li>Image segmentation and histograms</li>
<li>Basic machine learning and keypoint-based object detection</li>
<li>Affine and Perspective transforms and their applications to panoramas</li>
<li>3D geometry and stereo vision</li>
<li>Embedded computer vision: Running OpenCV programs on the Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
