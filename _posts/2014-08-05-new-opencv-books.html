<p>Interested in computer vision, but don't know where to start? <em>Practical Python and OpenCV</em> is your quick start guide to learning the basics of computer vision and image processing...in a single weekend.</p>
<p><em>Practical Python and OpenCV</em> covers the very basics of computer vision, starting from answering the question “what's a pixel?” all the way up to more challenging tasks such as edge detection, thresholding, and finding objects in images.</p>
<p>This book is very example driven, with lots of visual examples and tons of code.</p>
<p>So, if you're a student, programmer, or developer looking to get started in computer vision, look no further than <em>Practical Python and OpenCV!</em></p>
<div>Here's a breakdown of what this book covers:</div>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Computer Vision</li>
<li>Python and Required Packages</li>
<li>Loading, Displaying, and Saving</li>
<li>Image Basics</li>
<li>Drawing</li>
<li>
Image Processing</p>
<ul>
<li>Image Transformations</li>
<li>Image Arithmetic</li>
<li>Bitwise Operations</li>
<li>Masking</li>
<li>Splitting and Merging Channels</li>
<li>Converting Color Spaces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Histograms</li>
<li>Smoothing and Blurring</li>
<li>Gradients and Edge Detection</li>
<li>Contours</li>
</ul>
<p>The book (and accompanying source code) can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/practical-python-opencv/">PyImageSearch website</a>.</p>


<h3>Case Studies</h3>

<p>From face detection, to handwriting recognition, to matching keypoints and SIFT descriptors, <em>Case Studies: Solving real-world problems with computer vision</em> has one goal: to make you awesome at solving computer vision problems.</p>
<p>This book is intended for developers and programmers who understand the basics of computer vision and are ready to apply their skills to solve actual, real-world problems.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what types of real-world computer vision problems you'll learn to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Face and Eye Detection in Photos and Video</li>
<li>Color Object Tracking in Video</li>
<li>Handwriting Recognition using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)</li>
<li>Plant Classification with Machine Learning</li>
<li>Matching Keypoints and SIFT descriptors to build a Book Cover Identifier</li>
</ul>
<p>All problems are covered in detail, with lots of visual examples and code. After reading <em>Case Studies</em>, you'll be able to apply these techniques to solve computer vision problems of your own.</p>
<p><em>Case Studies</em> (and accompanying source code) can be purchased from the <a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/case-studies/">PyImageSearch website</a>.</p>
<p>The author, Adrian Rosebrock holds a Ph.D in computer science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.</p>
