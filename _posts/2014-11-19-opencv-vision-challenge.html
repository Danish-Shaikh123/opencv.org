<p>OpenCV Foundation with support from DARPA and Intel Corporation are launching a community-wide challenge to update and extend the OpenCV library with state-of-art algorithms. An award pool of $50,000 is provided to reward submitters of the best performing algorithms in the following 11 CV application areas: (1) <em>image segmentation</em>, (2) <em>image registration</em>, (3) <em>human pose estimation</em>, (4) <em>SLAM</em>, (5) <em>multi-view stereo matching</em>, (6) <em>object recognition</em>, (7) <em>face recognition</em>, (8) <em>gesture recognition</em>, (9) <em>action recognition</em>, (10) <em>text recognition</em>, (11) <em>tracking</em>.</p>
<h4>Conditions:</h4>
<p>The OpenCV Vision Challenge Committee will judge up to five best entries.</p>
<p>You may submit a new algorithm developed by yourself or your implementation of an existing algorithm even if you are not the author of the algorithm. <br />
You may enter any number of categories. <br />
If your entry wins the contest you will be awarded $1K.<br />
To win an additional $7.5 to $9K, you must contribute the source code as an OpenCV pull request under a BSD license. <br />
You acknowledge that your contributed code may be included, with your copyright, in OpenCV.</p>
<p>You may explicitly enter code for any work you have submitted to CVPR 2015 or its workshops. We will not unveil it until after CVPR.</p>
<p>Winners and prizes are at the sole discretion of the committee.</p>
<h4>Timeline:</h4>
<p>Submission Period: Now - May 8th 2015 <br />
Winners Announcement: June 8th 2015 at CVPR 2015</p>
