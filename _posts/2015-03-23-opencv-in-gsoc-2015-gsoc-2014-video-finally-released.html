<p>Well, in its awesomeness, Google is sponsoring OpenCV for the 5th year in a row! Thank you!</p>
<p>OpenCV page on GSoC website: <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/opencv">https://www.google-melange.<wbr />com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/<wbr />opencv</a></p>
<p>Google Summer of Code is a global program that offers post-secondary student developers aged 18+ stipends to write code for various open source software projects. We have worked with open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together over 7,500 successful student participants and over 7,000 mentors from over 100 countries worldwide to produce over 50 million lines of code. Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>
<p>We have setup guidelines on how to apply <a href="http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2015">here</a>. You have until March 27th to apply so be quick if you want your work in a cool video like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA">2014</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA">2013</a>!</p>
