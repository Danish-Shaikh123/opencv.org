With this small <a href="http://www.tsdconseil.fr/log/opencv/demo/index-en.html">graphical OpenCV demonstrator</a>, one can explore different image processing functions included in OpenCV, without having to write a single line of code!</p>
<p>Based on OpenCV 3.0 and Gtkmm 3.0, this graphical interface allows one to select an image processing function (for instance: face recognition), and then a demonstration of the function automatically displays. It is also possible to modify the computing parameters, or to specify another input image or video (or even processing the video stream from a webcam).</p>
<p>Example of supported functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Derivation: Gradient / laplacian computing, contours delimitation</li>
<li>Hough transforms: lines, segments, circles, and geometrical shapes detection</li>
<li>Histograms: computing, equalization, and object localization with backprojection algorithm</li>
<li>Segmentation: thresholding, distance transform, foreground / background detection, watershed segmentation</li>
<li>Filtering: linear and non linear filters, morphological operations</li>
<li>Cascade detectors: detection of face, eye, car plates</li>
<li>Interest points: detection and matching</li>
<li>Video processing: optical flow, background substraction, camshift (object tracking)</li>
<li>Photography: panoramas realization, high definition imaging (HDR), image inpainting</li>
</ul>
<p>Supported languages: english, french.</p>
<p>Installation: self-executable installer for Windows (32 bits).</p>
