<p>On May 25, Intel signed a definitive agreement to acquire Itseez, Inc., an expert in Computer Vision (CV) algorithms and implementations for embedded and specialized hardware. Itseez contributes software tuning and integration in many market-leading products shipping today from cars to security systems and more. This acquisition furthers Intel’s efforts to win in IoT market segments like automotive and video, where the ability to electronically perceive and understand images paves the way for innovation and opportunity. </p>
<p>Itseez will become a key ingredient for Intel’s Internet of Things Group (IOTG) roadmap, and will help Intel's customers create innovative deep-learning based CV applications like autonomous driving, digital security and surveillance, and industrial inspection. Itseez is also a key contributor to computer vision standards initiatives including OpenCV and OpenVX. Together, we’ll step up our contribution to these standards bodies - defining a technology bridge that helps the industry move more quickly to OpenVX-based products.</p>
<p>As the Internet of Things evolves, we see three distinct phases emerging. The first is to make everyday objects smart – this is well underway with everything from smart toothbrushes to smart car seats now available. The second is to connect the unconnected, with new devices connecting to the cloud and enabling new revenue, services, and savings. New devices like cars and watches are being designed with connectivity and intelligence built into the device. The third is just emerging where devices will require constant connectivity and will need the intelligence to make real-time decisions based on their surroundings. This is the “autonomous era,” and machine learning and computer vision will become critical for all kinds of machines – cars among them.  </p>
<p>Intel is focused on delivering end-to-end IoT solutions addressing devices, networks and the cloud. The IoT future we’re building for our customers is exciting, and the talented team at Itseez will help us get there, faster.</p>
